`Flights_Consolidation_Script.R` This script filters data by the top 10 airports and airlines, consolidating each month's data obtained from the DOT into a single master dataset. (Output file located in `../Data_Files/Flights_Data_MASTER.zip`)

`Flights_Wrangling_Script.py` This script processes and cleans the master dataset, preparing it for model training and analysis by transforming it into a structured format suitable for our explanatory models and analysis.
